# Synth
![build](https://github.com/n-e-l/synth/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

A simple shader based synth. This is a playground project.

## What it could become

- A synth component for a custom DAW
  - Would require an API
- The DAW itself

My intention is to create music with my own software as a challenge.
